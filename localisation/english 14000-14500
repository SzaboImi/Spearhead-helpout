    	Able to fire faster and more accurately than its heavier Allied counterparts, the leFH 18 was also able to engage enemy armor with direct fire. Despite being gradually outclassed, it remained the standard fieldpiece of the SS until war’s end.
    	The workhorse of the Waffen-SS, the dependable Opel not only transported troops to the front, but also supplies and weapons.
    	The Sdkfz. 251/20 was designed to work in tandem with infrared equipped Panthers and ‘Vampir’ scopes on the Stg 44, using its 60 cm IR searchlight to illuminate targets out to 1.5 km. A rare and unique vehicle, only sixty ‘Uhu’ were produced.
    	Capable of saturating large swaths of land with six 300 mm rockets, the Wurfrahmen 40 was also devastatingly effective against urban environments. Mounted on the mobile Sdkfz. 251, it was constantly requested for by SS Panzer forces.
    	More agile than the larger 251 ‘Hanomag’, the Sdkfz. 250 offered a single squad the same protection and support. Gains veterancy from nearby allies.
