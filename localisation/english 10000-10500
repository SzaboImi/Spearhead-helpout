    	First seeing combat at the Battle of France in 1940, 'Death's Head' Division has fought in many of the war's major battles, Considered the Waffen-SS' very elite, they forged a legendary reputation with their combat prowess and brutality.
    	Known for their ruthlessness both in and out of combat, the division's core members were originally drawn from concentration camp guards, before 
    	The Totenkopf has adorned German military uniforms for centuries, from 17th century Prussia to World War I Sturmtruppen. Adopted by concentration camp guards who formed the 3rd SS, it became synonymous with Nazi atrocities.
    	Raised from the center of France, the 'G√∂tz von Berlichingen' Division was formed from ethnic Germans and French volunteers. Being the only Panzergrenadiere division in Normandy, it inflicted severe casualties against three entire US divisions.
    	The 17th SS forged a colored history, culminating in the ‚Äòstrangest battle of World War II‚Äô. Over 200 men from ‚ÄòGvB‚Äô assaulted Castle Itter, which was defended by less than 30 Wehrmacht and US forces and a defected Waffen-SS officer.
    	Raised from the center of France, the 'G√∂tz von Berlichingen' Division was formed from ethnic Germans and French volunteers. Being the only Panzergrenadiere division in Normandy, it inflicted severe casualties against three entire US divisions.
    	With a motto of 
    	Nicknamed after a quote from their namesake, the ‚ÄòLick my Ass‚Äô Division fought with reckless abandon. Impressed by their fighting spirit, General Patton planned to reactivate the division to fight alongside the Allies in the Cold War.
    	Created in November 1944, the SS-Panzer-Brigade 150 was a unit of ‚Äòmisfits‚Äô. Drawing its men from both the Waffen-SS and Wehrmacht, it was tasked with infiltrating enemy lines during the Ardennes campaign to sow panic and chaos.
    	The best English speakers of the 150th, the ‚ÄòEinheit Stielau‚Äô commandos shattered Allied morale and paralyzed coordination. Spreading fear and disarray, they caused several U.S. units to detain high-ranking officers and commit fratricide.
    	The 'January' Division's name originates from Hitler rise to power in January 30th, 1933. Coincidentally, the division itself was formed 12 years later in the January of 1945 to fight in the fateful Battle of Berlin.
    	After decimating the French army in 1940 the 3rd spearheaded Barbarossa, only to sustain eighty percent casualties in early 1942. Reformed as a Panzergrenadier division, it was crippled a year later in the attempt to relieve the 6. Armee.
    	Originally fighting as the SS-Verf√ºgungstruppe, the predecessors to the Waffen-SS, they were intended to serve as Hitler's personal army. However, political infighting led to the SS-VT being placed under army command, within their own divisions.
    	The 'Das Reich' helped reclaim Kharkov in 1943, and later fought in the Kursk Salient, sustaining heavy casualties. Pulled again to France in October 1943 for refit, the unit was reorganized as the 2nd SS-Panzer Division before fighting the Allies in Normandy.
    	The 'Empire' Division had fought as a regimental for two years before becoming full-fledged division in 1941. 
    	The 'Das Reich' Division fought early on in the war as a regiment, suffering thousands of casualties during the height of Operation Barbarossa. However, the unit is known for mercilessly gunning down hundreds of French civilians and resistance fighters.

    	The 9th SS-Panzer Division is named after a Germanic noble family reigning from the thirteenth to fourteenth century. Best known for their successful actions at Caen and during Market Garden, they are solid, dependable line infantry when on the defensive.
    	The 9th SS-Panzer Division's core was formed primarily from men serving in the Reichsarbeitsdienst (Reich Labor Service), an organization that provided combat support via logistics and constructing defensive fortifications.

    	Ordered to hold its positions at all costs, the 12,000 man strong 352nd ‚ÄòPegasus Division‚Äô faced the full force of Operation Overlord. Absorbing all manners of personnel to replenish its appalling losses, most of the unit fought to the last man.
    	Formed in late 1944 around 272. Infanterie-Division veterans, the division was reinforced using excess Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine personnel. Barely escaping the H√ºrtgen Forest and Ardennes, the unit finally capitulated at the Ruhr Pocket.
    	Formed in 1940 as the 15. Panzer-Division, the unit was sent to fight under the Afrika-Korps in April 1941. Spirited and led by the legendary Rommel, the 15th crippled British forces at Halfaya Pass and helped capture Tobruk in June 1942.
    	Formed in August 1941, the Afrika-Division z.b.V was designed to rebalance the Afrika-Korps. Renamed the 90. leichte-Afrika-Division in November, it sustained heavy losses at Sidi Rezegh during the breakout of the Tobruk garrison.
    	Sent to Italy in 1943, the 278. Infanterie-Division simultaneously manned coastal defenses and conducted anti-partisan operations. Battered while defending the Gothic Line, remnants were reformed in early 1945 as Volksgrenadiere.
    	Expertly-trained, well-armed, and guided by excellent leadership, the 3rd Fallschirmj√§gers suffered from a constant lack of manpower; they almost always arrived to the battle with six to twenty times as much firepower than their enemies.
    	Formed from survivors of the 47th Infantrie, it was typically thought to be too inexperienced to fight. However, the division fought remarkably well during the H√ºrtgenwald Campaign against the US 1st Infantry Division, known as the 'Big Red One.'
    	Intended to be a reserve division, the penal troops of the 500th Infanterie-Ersatz-Bataillon fought bravely to regain their rights as soldiers, and as citizens of the Third Reich. The division fought at Charkow, Kaukasus and Krymskaja.
    	Rising from the dead, the 246th participated in heavy fighting in Smolensk before being destroyed, and subsequently reformed as a Volksgrenadiere division in 1944. Led by well-trained and experienced commanders, they quickly proved their worth.
    	Composed of sixty-percent non-combat personnel, the 183rd sustained debilitating losses while defending Aachen. Crippled beyond recovery, survivors were used to reinforce the depleted 9th Panzer and 15th Panzergrenadier divisions.
