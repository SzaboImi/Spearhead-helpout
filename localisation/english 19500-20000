    	Throughout Her Majesty's forces, Bren Light Machine Gun granted advancing infantry unprecedented firepower. This principle of squad-based automatic fire would continue to see usage in future conflicts.
    	Though uncommon, assault teams were organized with a higher number of Thompsons to dramatically increase close-quarters firepower.
    	Finding service with various commando & airborne forces, the M1A1 Carbine proved to be an effective design.

    	Despite a halt on production by 1944 in favor of the Ausf. G, the ‘Panther A’ had already made its mark. The first tank to effectively fuse mobility, armor and firepower, the Ausf. A was considered to be the grandfather of the main battle tank.

    	Reinforced with a stronger turret, suspension and engine, the Ausf. A combined the armor and firepower of a ‘Tiger’ with the mobility of the Panzer IV. Replacing the unreliable Ausf. D, the ‘Panther A’ was a dynamic and lethal opponent.
    	Within its short lifespan, the Ausf. A proved more than worthy of further development. Replaced by the Ausf. G in 1944, remaining ‘Panther A’ models augmented their mightier sibling and later helped mitigate increased heavy Panzer losses.
    	An upgrade to the beloved Cromwell IV, the Mk. V received enhancements to vision, mobility and engine performance. Reinforced with additional welded armour, the Mk. V could weather most engagements with the vaunted Panzers.

    	Formed from the old 87th Rifle Division in January 1942, the unit faced its first test at Kharkov that May. Losing over fifty-percent of its men in the intense battle, the 13th did manage to escape utter annihilation unlike most other Soviet units.
    	Despite the unit’s desperate need for resupply and men, the Motherland’s need was greater. Filled with untrained conscripts and lacking maps or knowledge of the city, the 13th was ordered to hold the battered ruins of the once proud Stalingrad.
    	Deemed ‘ready’ for combat, the 13th was sent across the Volga to reinforce a line held by a mere 15 tanks and few hastily formed combat groups. Within the first 24 hours the unit suffered 3,000 casualties, but successfully held the beachhead.
    	Despite its disadvantages, the 13th proved its worth first at the Railroad and later in the perilous sixty-day defense for Pavlov’s House. Constantly short on rations and supplies in both fights, the Guardsmen fought until only a handful remained.
    	No stranger to sacrifice, the 13th repeatedly distinguished itself in Stalingrad. Although only 320 men of the original 10,000 survived the chaotic struggle, what arose from the ashes was one of the Red Army’s most elite and respected units.
    	Faithful guardians of the Soviet people, the 13th helped secure Kursk in 1943 and later liberate Ukraine. Under Operation Bagration the unit paved its way from Poland to Berlin with retribution before finally seizing the very heart of the Reich.

    	Built in 1923, the 46th spent most of its first life in Irkutsk. Still at a peacetime strength of 6,000 when the Fascists invaded the Motherland, the unit’s fresh recruits and depleted staff fell rapidly to veteran German troops at Smolensk in July 1941.
    	Reformed after Smolensk at Ufa, the 46th was often used to ‘distract’ the enemy before a retreat or an assault. Fighting exclusively on the frontline in an attempt to stall the Fascisti, the unit was sacrificed again at Volkhov Pocket in mid 1942.
    	Formed in early 1942, the 13-ya faced its first test at Kharkov that May. Losing over fifty-percent of its men in the ferocious battle, the unit did manage to retreat to the Volga and escape complete annihilation unlike most of the other Soviet units.
    	Although the unit desperately needed resupply, the Motherland’s need was greater. Crossing the mighty Volga to reinforce the tentative beachhead to once proud Stalingrad, the 13th suffered over 3,000 casualties in the first 24 hours alone.
    	Despite its disadvantages, the 13th proved its worth at the Railroad Station and in the perilous sixty-day defense for Pavlov’s House. Constantly short on rations and supplies in both fights, the Guardsmen fought until only a handful remained.

    	Like many Wehrmacht units located in Normandy, the 91st was understrength and underequipped. Filled using young trainees, old reservists, recovering Ostfront veterans and conscripts, the 91st was ill prepared to fight against Allied forces.
    	Transferred to Aachen in late 1944, the 246th repulsed repeated U.S. assaults for five days using well constructed strong-points. Despite its dogged defense, the 246th was eventually overrun and later reassigned to defend the Hürtgenwald.
    	Decimated again by heavy fighting at Hürtgenwald, the 246th spent the rest of the war plugging gaps in Wehrmacht lines. Fighting until the absolute end, it surrendered to U.S. forces after the capitulation of the Third Reich on May 8, 1945.
    	Using defense in depth and overwhelming firepower, the 3rd FJD held St.-Lô for a month against U.S. forces. Finally exhausting their supplies, the 3rd was pushed to the Falaise Pocket in August only to be obliterated in the breakout attempt.
    	Reformed from scratch in September 1944, the 3rd FJD helped defend Arnhem during Operation Market Garden. Later fighting in the Hürtgenwald meat-grinder and the Ardennes offensive, the unit finally surrendered to U.S. forces in 1945.
    	Fighting partisans for most of 1943, ‘Brandenburg’ was formed into a Panzergrenadier Division in late 1944. Fighting under Division ‘Großdeutschland’ until war’s end, most of the unit avoided capture and simply vanished without a trace.
    	Cunning demolitionists, ‘Brandenburg’ Sprengtruppe were trained to use both Axis and Allied explosives to complete missions. Vital to the conquest of Europe, these men disabled and seized valuable enemy installations and infrastructure.
    	Loaded with extra radio equipment, the Sd.Kfz. 261 broadcasts long-range orders direct from the 90th. Improving communication between vehicles, the ‘Kleiner Panzerfunkwagen’ gains vet from allies for its role in coordinating movements.
    	Composed of multiple combat specialists, ‘Julia’ was some of the Italian Army’s finest. Versatile, highly motivated and self-sustaining, the 3rd used its portable weapons to combat Greek troops in 1941 and Soviet forces at the Don in fall 1942.
    	First used by the Reichswehr, the versatile and compact leIG 18 was truly a multi-role weapon. Utilized extensively by the Gebirgsjäger and Fallschirmjäger as light artillery, it could also engage enemy armor with direct fire.

    	Trading some mobility for protection, the ‘Sd.Kfz. 162’ received Schürzen and the longer 7.5 cm KwK 42 L/70 in fall 1944. Praised for its ability to withstand punishment, this Jagdpanzer could easily defeat all but the heaviest enemy tanks.
    	Despite a halt on production by 1944 in favor of the Ausf. G, the ‘Panther A’ had already made its mark. The first tank to effectively fuse mobility, armor and firepower, the Ausf. A was considered to be the grandfather of the main battle tank.
    	Multilingual clandestine operatives, ‘Brandenburger’ were trained to near perfection in sabotage, recon, marksmanship and various other skills. Formed as Sonderverband Brandenburg in 1939, the unit was instrumental in the conquest of Europe.
    	A hybrid of cavalry and infantry, the talented men of the ‘Recce Corps’ formed the spearhead of the British Army throughout the war. Drilled to seize initiative with an aggressive spirit, scouts typified the motto ‘Only The Enemy In Front’.
    	Recce Corps Marksman Team
    	Already specialised in multiple skills, ‘Recce’ scouts were eventually sent through marksman school. Filling the gaps in the haphazardly rebuilt sniper program, these men often used the Boys AT rifle to punch through armour and infantry.
    	Standing silently at the Buckingham Palace to this day, the venerable Grenadier Guard fought valiantly during the Battle of France and evacuation of Dunkirk, holding the line for others to withdraw back to Britain, and continuing to serve ever since.
    	Formed under the orders of Queen Victoria at the turn of the twentieth century, in honor of Ireland’s war contributions. The Irish Guard have a brief but decorated service record, serving with distinction on the Western Front during both World Wars.

    	The 17th SS forged a colored history, culminating in the ‘strangest battle of World War II’. Over 200 men from ‘GvB’ assaulted Castle Itter, which was defended by less than 30 Wehrmacht and U.S. forces and a defected Waffen-SS officer.
    	Unable to kill Tito, the 500th was shifted to Lithuania in July 1944 to help the 3. Panzerarmee. Reduced to less than ninety men by August, the unit was pulled to Austria and absorbed into the newly built SS-Fallschirmjäger-Bataillon 600.
    	With 360° of traverse, the FlaK 38 could hammer ground and air targets. Appearing more often in its quad barrelled Flakvierling version, the 2 cm gun was used prolifically as Germany was forced into a defensive role on both fronts.
    	Mass produced for the versatile SS Panzergrenadiere and Sturmpioniere, the Sdkfz. 251/16 was armed with dual flame projectors. Able to reach targets at 35 m, the ‘Flammpanzerwagen’ could callously reduce enemies of the Reich to ash.
    	The backbone of SS mechanized recon units, the four-wheel-drive Sdkfz. 221 was advanced for its time. Relying on mobility as its primary characteristic, it provided its two-man crew adequate small arms protection with 14.5 mm of armor.
