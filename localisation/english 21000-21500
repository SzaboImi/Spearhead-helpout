    	Soviet infantry, and crewed weapons are brave, but lesser trained; troops should close-in with the enemy, where their numbers and firepower will prevail.
    	Soviet light vehicles can easily destroy enemy light vehicles, thanks to their high mobility & potent weapons. However, their accuracy and armor is generally lacking.
    	Soviet tanks during the early war period 
    	Late-war Soviet tanks are built to destroy enemy tanks through raw firepower. Though not as accurate or even as mobile, they are far more versatile against incoming infantry or defenses.
    	Early-war Soviet tanks possess both reliability and maneuverability, but suffer from inferior firepower; they are best used at closer ranges against tanks, or providing infantry support.
    	The Waffen-SS is a highly-aggressive fighting force, able to inflict massive casualties while on the offensive. However, losing too much men can easily lead to defeat for this faction.
    	Waffen-SS infantry, and crewed weapons are precise, and utterly merciless against their foes. Despite their superior training, close-quarters should be avoided until properly armed.
    	Waffen-SS light vehicles provide swift infantry support to the frontline, both in the form of logistical, and combat support. They should maintain distance between enemy light vehicles, and anti-tank.
    	Waffen-SS tanks, and assault guns favor aggressive action to defeat their foes. Though not as well-equipped as their Wehrmacht brethren, they are more than able to handle most enemy tanks.
    	British tanks rely on either heavy armor plating or speed to achieve victory, neither types are able to function properly without support.
    	British light vehicles, and crewed weapons are usually lightly-armored with heavy firepower. Speed should be utilized to improve their survivability.
    	The British Army is a highly-disciplined army, able to employ superior tactics and training to win. Unremarkable weaponry, and poor unit preservation is the bane of this faction.
    	The United States Army is a fresh, but formidable force, using aggressive tactics and unrelenting firepower to get the job done. Long distance combat, and indecisiveness are this faction's weaknesses.

    	Small teams of advanced recon troops, Wehrmacht Aufklärer were meticulously trained to gather all essential intelligence. Proficient marksmen and survivalists, they operated in close proximity to Allied lines with minimal friendly assistance.
    	Built as Infanterie in August 1939, the 78th initially served as occupational troops in France until May 1941. Spearheading Barbarossa in June, the division devastated Soviet forces with impunity until suffering heavy losses at Rzhev in late 1942.
    	Redesignated as a Sturm-Division in early 1943, the 78th held valiantly at Kursk before its forced retreat. Outnumbered 9:1 at Orsha in mid 1944, the unit was destroyed after two long days only to be resurrected that Fall as a Volks-Sturm-Division.
    	Reformed as Panzergrenadiere mid 1943, the 25th was rendered ineffective at Minsk a year later. Rebuilt on the Westfront, the unit fought under the Waffen-SS at the Maginot Line and Ardennes before its transfer to and destruction at Berlin.
    	One of the first Wehrmacht units to form, the 25th fought in France before its reorganisation as a motorised division in Fall 1940. Constantly on the frontline in Russia, ‘Stuttgarter Haus’ endured almost nonstop heavy combat until early 1943.
    	78. Volks-Sturm-Division Sturmgrenadiere
    	Short on supplies and troops, the 3rd Romanian collapsed rapidly under the might of Operation Uranus. Barely escaping Russia’s armies or Winter, the 3rd turned against its former German ally after the armistice with the Soviets in 1944.
    	Ordered to hold its positions at all costs, the 12,000 man strong 352nd ‘Pegasus Division’ faced the full force of Operation Overlord. Absorbing all manners of personnel to replenish appalling losses, most of the unit fought to the last man.
    	Accustomed to combat on the Ostfront, 352nd Stoßtruppen were well prepared to repel the waves of invaders. Combining superior firepower and support artillery with shock tactics, these troops forced the Allies to pay for every inch of ground.
    	Comprised of various troops and specialists, Stoßtruppen were some of the best the Wehrmacht had to offer. Capable of delivering unparalleled firepower and supported by powerful artillery and assault guns, these men were rightfully feared.
    	An Infanterie division from 1934, the 5th was a vital part of the conquest and later occupation of France. Sent to Ostpreußen in early 1941, the unit suffered heavy casualties during the successful destruction of several enemy divisions at Vyazma.
    	Redesignated a Jäger division in mid 1942, the unit spent the rest of its life clinging to tentative defenses at Demjansk and Staraja Russa. Slowly driven back across the Ostfront, the 5th made its final stand amidst the smoldering ashes of Berlin.
    	Division Großdeutschland Panzergrenadiere
    	A pre-war ceremonial guard unit, ‘Großdeutschland’ first fought in France before being nearly obliterated at the Battle of Moscow. Reformed in April 1942, it was rendered combat ineffective by combined Soviet offensives that Winter.
    	Transferred from Italy in Fall 1944, the 15th fought valiantly but futilely to stem the Allied tide. Sent to the Rheinland in February 1945, the unit made its final stand during its tenacious defense of the famous Hochwald Gap in early March.
    	Created in late 1943 from experienced training cadre, Panzer Lehr was the only fully mechanized Panzer division of the war. Assigned to Normandy in early 1944, ‘Lehr’ suffered seventy-percent casualties fighting against Operation Cobra.
    	Multilingual clandestine operatives, ‘Brandenburger’ were trained to near perfection in sabotage, recon, marksmanship and various other skills. Formed as Sonderverband Brandenburg in 1939, the unit was instrumental in the conquest of Europe.
    	Renamed Division Brandenburg in 1943 for its service, the unit was reformed under Division ‘Großdeutschland’ in late 1944. Fighting until war’s end as Panzergrenadiere, most of the unit avoided capture and vanished without a trace.
    	Composed of multiple combat specialists, ‘Julia’ was some of the Italian Army’s finest. Versatile, highly motivated and self-sustaining, the 3rd used its portable weapons to combat Greek troops in 1941 and Soviet forces at the Don in Fall 1942.
    	Trained primarily through trial by fire, ‘Toscana’ acted as anti-partisan and coastal defense troops in France until Fall 1943. Shifted to Rome with only 3 active battalions, they held vital airfields for two long, grueling days before disintegrating.
    	Lacking heavy towed weaponry, the 3rd quickly collapsed at the Don. Pulled from Russia with less than 3,000 men and rebuilt in Summer 1943, ‘Julia’ and many Alpini troops used the high mountains of Italy to bitterly resist Allied forces.
