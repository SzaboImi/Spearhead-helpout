    	The Coldstream Guard hold the honor of being the oldest serving regiment within the British Army, from the American Revolution, to the Napoleonic Wars. They are well-trained, and equipped with rapid-fire American firearms.
    	Faithful since its 1715 formation, the Hussars served with distinction at Waterloo, under the Light Brigade in Crimea and in the Great War. Stationed in Egypt since 1936, the 11th was thrown into the fray once more against Italian forces in 1940.
    	Forced out of Sicily in August 1943, the 15th was the chief defender at Salerno where it inflicted severe casualties. The linchpin of Germany’s Gustav and Winter Lines, the unit halted numerous Allied assaults from late 1943 until June 1944.
    	Rebuilt as a Panzergrenadier division, ‘Großdeutschland’ suffered repeated losses as it retreated west after Kursk. Sent to East Prussia in late 1944, it narrowly escaped annihilation at Memel only to be obliterated at Pillau in April 1945.
    	Transferred to Aachen in late 1944, the 246th repulsed repeated U.S. assaults for five days using well constructed strong-points. Despite its dogged defense, the 246th was eventually overrun and later reassigned to the Hürtgen Forest.
    	Decimated again by heavy fighting at Hürtgen Forest, the 246th spent the rest of the war plugging gaps in Wehrmacht lines. Fighting until the end, it surrendered to U.S. forces after the capitulation of the Third Reich on May 8, 1945.
    	Formed in 1941 as an Infanterie division, the 246th fought in the brutal battle for Smolensk before its destruction in mid 1944. Resurrected as Volksgrenadiere, some of its new recruits had received less than ten days of infantry training.
    	Intended to be a reserve unit, the 500th was rushed east to capture Kharkov in late 1941. Fighting later in the Caucasus in 1942, Cuban in 1943 and Crimea in 1944, it drew its final breath during the defense of the Carpathians in early 1945.
    	Wehrmacht Strafbataillone were filled with both civilian and military criminals, men who had lost their rights as citizens of the Third Reich. Considered disposable troops, they were continuously assigned nearly suicidal combat missions.
    	Bewährungsbataillon 500 Straftruppen
    	Bewährungsbataillon 500 Veteranen
    	Unlike their Soviet counterparts, Wehrmacht Straftruppen could redeem themselves through service. Driven to regain their citizenship and tempered by countless near suicidal missions, these men became brutally efficient fighters.
    	Reformed after its obliteration in Stalingrad, the 45th was slowly pushed across the Balkan states. Surrendering in the Alps in 1945, it had been used as engineers, infantry, tank hunters, weapon crews and mechanized assault troops.
    	Created in 1943 to counter rising desertion, the Feldjägerkorps superseded the Feldgendarmerie. Known as ‘Hero snatchers’ for their brutal policing methods, these men could execute any SS or Wehrmacht personnel for duty violations.
    	Built around remnants of the 47. Infanterie-Division, the unit was transferred in late 1944 for the defense of the Hürtgenwald. Considered too inexperienced to fight, the 47th helped inflict severe casualties on two major U.S. Army Corps.
    	Building a system of interwoven defenses, 3rd FJD Pioniere transformed the bocage country of St.-Lô into a fortress. Turning every enclosed field into a deathtrap, no Allied unit was willing to enter what became known as ‘Hedgerow Hell’.
    	3. Fallschirmjäger-Division Pioniere
    	Expertly trained and led by excellent leadership, ninety percent of the 3rd Fallschirmjäger troops were airborne qualified. Well armed, it almost always arrived to the battlefield with six to twenty times more firepower than its enemies.
    	The 3rd FJD used defense in depth to hold St. Lô and Normandy, only to be obliterated during the escape from the Falaise Pocket. Reformed in 1944, the unit fought in Market Garden and the Ardennes before surrendering in 1945.

    	The 9th SS recruited primarily from the Reichsarbeitsdienst, an organization designed to provide combat support via logistics and fortification construction. Engineering experts, these men built defenses that immobilized Allied advances.
    	Raised in France in early 1943 as Panzergrenadiere, ‘Hohenstaufen’ was redesignated as a Panzer division in October. Rushed to Ukraine to stem the Soviet onslaught, it fought alongside its sister, the 10th SS-Panzer-Division ‘Frundsberg’.
    	The 9th SS bore the name of a thirteenth century Germanic noble family and is best known for its actions during Market Garden. Facing the 10,000 man strong British 1st Airborne at Arnhem, the 9th inflicted over 7,000 casualties.
    	In March 1944 ‘Hohenstaufen’ was tasked with rescuing the Wehrmacht’s 1. Panzerarmee from encirclement. After fighting for three days at Tarnopol, the 9th broke through Soviet lines and helped save over 200,000 Axis troops.
    	Built in 1943, the 10th SS ‘Frundsberg’ was constantly transferred between the West and Ostfront. Fighting in Russia, Caen and Arnhem, its final act was a breakthrough of the Halbe Pocket before racing west to surrender to U.S. forces.
    	Desperately needed on the Westfront, the 9th SS lost half of its armor to mechanical failures en route to Normandy. Thrown into the battles of Caen and Falaise, British forces reduced the unit’s combat strength to fifty-percent.
    	Ordered to take Bastogne during the Ardennes campaign, ‘Hohenstaufen’ took horrendous losses. Refitted in early 1945, it narrowly escaped Soviet encirclement at Budapest before fighting its way west and surrendering to US forces.
    	Desperately needed on the Westfront, the 9th SS lost half of its armor to mechanical failures en route to Normandy. Thrown into the battles of Caen and Falaise, British forces reduced the unit’s combat strength to fifty-percent.
    	Trained primarily through trial by fire, ‘Toscana’ acted as anti-partisan and coastal defense troops in France until fall 1943. Shifted to Rome with only 3 active battalions, the 7th held vital airfields for two long, grueling days before disintegrating.
    	Lacking heavy towed weaponry, the 3rd quickly collapsed at the Don. Pulled from Russia with less than 3,000 men and rebuilt in summer 1943, ‘Julia’ and many Alpini troops used the high mountains of Italy to bitterly resist Allied forces.
    	Lacking heavy towed weaponry, the 3rd quickly collapsed at the Don. Pulled from Russia with less than 3,000 men and rebuilt in summer 1943, ‘Julia’ and many Alpini troops used the high mountains of Italy to bitterly resist Allied forces.
    	Only 40,000 men of the 2nd Hungarian returned home after the loss at Stalingrad. Rebuilt in late 1944, the 2nd crippled multiple Soviet tank corps under Wehrmacht command before its collapse during the siege of its national capital.
    	Like most Axis units in late war Hungary, the Szent László Division suffered heavy losses as it fought to stem the Red Tide. Pushed out of its homeland, the unit fought its way west to Austria where it surrendered to British forces.
    	Despite the supplies and weaponry it received from Germany, the 3rd Romanian was still ill prepared to fight in Russia. Relying mainly on its outdated 37 and 47 mm AT guns, it could barely stop Soviet armored forces.
    	Short on supplies and troops, the 3rd Romanian collapsed rapidly under the might of Operation Uranus. Barely escaping Russia’s armies or winter, the 3rd turned against its former German ally after the armistice with the Soviets in 1944.
    	The 3rd Romanian had only a handful of modern AT guns to combat the endless waves of Soviet armor. Forced to adopt more unconventional tactics, its men used everything from grenades and AT mines to Molotov cocktails to fight back.

    	Veteran demolitionists, Pioniere of the 600th were an integral part of the unit‘s missions to disrupt enemy supply lines. Sent to hold the Oder in February 1945, their skills as engineers helped grind repeated Soviet advances to a complete halt.
    	Created in September 1943 as SS-Fallschirmjäger-Bataillon 500, the unit recruited from both SS volunteers and SS-Bewährungsbataillone. Assigned Unternehmen Rösselsprung in June 1944, its task was to kill partisan leader Josip Broz Tito.
    	Originally an air-transportable unit, the 91st was redesignated as an infantry division and sent to France in early 1944. Beginning the Normandy campaign with roughly 10,500 men, the 91st was reduced to little more than 800 by late June.

    	Extensively trained to treat any wound their fanatical brethren sustained, medical personnel of the Waffen-SS ranged from field medics and stretcher bearers to professional surgeons and doctors.
    	Rigorously trained and unerringly accurate, SS Scharfschütze were experts at ranged combat and survival. Often cut off and isolated behind enemy lines, many fought without support until they exhausted their ammunition or lives.
    	Trained to actively stalk enemy armor, SS Panzerjäger employed hunter-killer tactics to locate and terminate armored threats. Fanatical, aggressive and armed with a Panzerschreck, few Allied vehicles were safe from these teams.
    	Always short on armor, the 17th SS made prolific use of Panzerjäger teams to counter the Allies. Zealous, mobile and extremely adaptable, these men infiltrated the battlefield at key moments to ambush enemy armor when least expected.
    	Bolstered by extra supplies, these troops can use abilities more frequently against Allied forces.
    	Authorized by the Führer in late 1944, the Volkssturm was Nazi Germany’s final desperate outcry against defeat. Filled with anyone able to fight, it conscripted old men, women and even children for the futile last defense of the Third Reich.
    	Using the familiar terrain of their homeland and issued powerful anti-tank weaponry, Volkssturm units trapped and destroyed countless enemy tanks. Surprisingly effective as Panzerjäger, even a single draftee posed a threat to Allied armor.
    	An ad hoc organization intended to boost morale, the Volkssturm disheartened remaining SS and Wehrmacht troops. Poorly trained and often under equipped, many Volkssturm units surrendered while others fought to the last man standing.
    	Despite continuously high losses, ‘Wallonien’ continued to request frontline service under the SS. Reinforced with fascist French and Spanish volunteers, the 28th SS fought courageously until the absolute end as a Panzergrenadier Division.
    	28. SS-Freiwilligen-Grenadier-Div. Grenadiere
    	Responsible for the rear of Army Group Center, the 8th waged a brutal war against civilians and partisans. Ordered to ‘clean’ the region by any and all means, the unit razed two dozen villages and butchered roughly 3,000 Soviet prisoners.
    	Reorganized as a Panzer division in late 1943, ‘Hitlerjugend’ fought a brutal war of attrition against the Allies. Heavily indoctrinated and devoutly loyal, these ‘men’ threw themselves at enemy fire and fought to their dying breath.
    	12. SS-Panzer-Division Panzergrenadiere
    	The development of superior tank armor made the highly portable PaK 36 obsolete by 1940. Used by the SS until the end of the war, the rapid firing ‘door knocker’ was extremely effective as an armored car and light vehicle killer.
    	Engineer infantry, (Traits: + Repair Tools, + Wire Cutters, + Faster Build Times): Extra weapon capacity, specializes in defensive operations, and fire support.

    	Sturmgewehr 44 Shipment (x2)
    	Maschinenkarabiner 42 (x2)
    	Commonly mistaken for the StG44, the MKb 42 is the predecessor to the iconic rifle, being issued a year earlier and serving to the end of the war.
    	Despite its unarmored nature and susceptibility to heavy fire, the Kübelwagen was praised by the Wehrmacht for its utility and dependability. The equivalent of the Allies’ Jeep or GAZ-67, it ended the war with only a few modifications.
    	An advanced four-wheel-drive scout car, the highly maneuverable Sdkfz. 221 was the workhorse of the Wehrmacht’s mechanized recon units. Outfitted with 14.5 mm of frontal armor, it reliably protected its two man crew from small arms.
    	Strapped with the protection of a Panzer IV and armed with the 2 cm KwK 30, the Panzer II J was almost unstoppable against soft targets. Remarkably durable and effective, only 22 models of this heavy light tank ever completed production.
    	A direct channel of communication with the SS-Führungshauptamt, this mobile radio allows commanders to call in additional SS-Kampfgruppen to supplement their force composition.
