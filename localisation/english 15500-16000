    	Fighting partisans for most of 1943, ‚ÄòBrandenburg‚Äô was formed into a Panzergrenadier Division in late 1944. Fighting under Division ‚ÄòGro√üdeutschland‚Äô until war‚Äôs end, most of the unit avoided capture and simply vanished without a trace.
    	3. FJD Stabsfeldwebel 
    	In need of manpower and armor, the 91st absorbed an assortment of infantrymen, French training tanks and elite paratroopers to bolster its ranks. Still short on supplies and outnumbered, it held its ground for two brutal weeks before collapsing.
    	After losing most of its remaining men at Cherbourg, the 91st was ‚Äòreformed‚Äô in late July for the defense of Rennes. Rendered unfit for duty, the 91st was officially disbanded in August and later absorbed by the 344. Infanterie-Division.
    	Raised in early 1943, the 6th Regiment fought in Russia and Italy before its transfer to France in April 1944. Attached to the 91. (LL)Infanterie-Division, the ‚Äòoversized‚Äô regiment was ordered to hold the town of Carentan with its 3,457 men.
    	Fallschirmj√§ger-Regiment 6 Fallschirmj√§ger
    	Despite its average age of 17 years, the 6th Regiment held Carentan for two long days before it had expended all its ammunition. Nicknamed the ‚ÄòLions of Carentan‚Äô, the unit left the brutal Normandy campaign with less than 400 men.
    	Unlike their Soviet counterparts, Wehrmacht Straftruppen could redeem themselves through service. Driven to regain their citizenship and tempered by countless near suicidal missions, these men became brutally efficient fighters.
    	Created in 1943 to counter rising desertion, the Feldj√§gerkorps superseded the Feldgendarmerie. Known as ‚ÄòHero snatchers‚Äô for their brutal policing methods, these men could execute any SS or Wehrmacht personnel for duty violations.
    	Sent to reinforce Kiev in early 1943, the 203rd sustained heavy losses against Soviet Operation Bagration later that year. Reformed as the 203. Infanterie-Division, the unit was finally encircled and annihilated at Narev in January 1945.

    	Based off the Czechoslovakian pre-war Panzer 38(t), the Hetzer united the dependable 7,5 cm PaK 39 with a low, sufficiently armored profile. Safer than the open topped Marder series, it was adept at tackling all but the heaviest armor.
    	In spite of rushed development in 1942 and an unsteady first year of service, the Tiger I gradually received valuable engine and drivetrain enhancements. By wars end, the iconic tank was as reliable as the mass-produced Panzer IV.
    	Covered in virtually impenetrable armor and armed with the upgraded 8.8 cm KwK 45 L/71, the Tiger II was truly the ‚ÄòKing‚Äô of German armor. Even though only 492 models ever entered active service, the tank was unrivaled on the field.
