    	Despite rushed development in 1942 and an unsteady first year of service, the ‘Tiger I’ gradually received valuable engine and drivetrain enhancements. By war’s end, the iconic tank was as reliable as the mass-produced Panzer IV.
    	Covered in virtually impenetrable armor and armed with the upgraded 8.8 cm KwK 45 L/71, the ‘Tiger II’ was truly the ‘King’ of German armor. Although only 492 models ever entered active service, the tank was unrivaled on the field.
    	Originally named after Ferdinand Porsche, the ‘Ferdinand’ was enveloped by 200 mm of armor. Proficient at destroying tanks out to 3 km with the 8.8 cm PaK 43/2 L/71, it claimed a record kill:loss ratio of 320:13 at Kursk.
