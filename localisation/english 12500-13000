    	The Untersturmführers (Second Lieutenants) are junior officers of the Waffen-SS, all having served with distinction within the enlisted ranks. Later in the war, many were granted the position out of dire necessity.
    	Instrumental in securing Belgium and Holland, the 7th spearheaded the push to the Maas in late 1944. Finally punching through German lines in early 1945, the division liberated Bergen-Belsen on April 6th before finishing the war at Hamburg.
    	Pulled to England in November 1943, the 7th was outfitted with new Cromwells and Fireflies for Overlord. Responsible for the capture of Villers-Bocage, the unit rendered both the 2. Panzer and Panzer-Lehr Divisions unfit for frontline service.
    	Commanded by Major-General Percy Hobart, the 79th was built in response to the tragic Dieppe Raid. Using Hobart’s technical expertise, the ‘Black Bulls’ engineered custom vehicles that could land on the beaches of France and continue inland.
    	The 79th introduced the concepts of APCs, mine flails, bridge layers, and LVTs, all of which became staples in modern combat. However, the odd designs of the vehicles earned them the colloquial nickname ‘Hobart’s Funnies’.
    	Operating as small detachments, the 79th tirelessly supported Allied units across the West Front.  An invaluable asset with their specialised vehicles, Winston Churchill ordered British forces not to engage unless the ‘Black Bulls’ were in support.
    	Fielding APCs, mine flails, bridge layers and LVTs, the 79th introduced concepts that later became staples of modern combat. Bizarre yet irreplaceable, the vehicles’ odd designs earned them the colloquial nickname ‘Hobart’s Funnies’.
    	Reformed with two battalions after Dunkirk, the Grenadier Guards served gallantly under the famed Eighth Army in Tunisia. Despite heavy casualties, the ‘Regiment’ fought until the North African campaign ended in May 1943. 
    	After Africa, the ‘Regiment’ served with distinction in Anzio, before forming the British vanguard in France. The Grenadier Guard liberated Brussels in mid-1944 and crossed Nijmegen Bridge in September, finishing the war in Germany.
    	Tracing its heritage to 1685, the Royal Fusiliers have served with distinction across the Empire. Attached to the British Expeditionary Force in 1940, the Fusiliers fought in the Battle of France before being evacuated from Dunkirk.
    	Serving two years as home defense, the Royal Fusiliers were sent to Tunisia in 1943. Transferred to Italy in September, the Fusiliers fought tenaciously at Salerno and Monte Cassino before relieving British forces at Anzio in February 1944.
    	After breaking out of Anzio, the Fusiliers were airlifted in October 1944 to fight in the Greek Civil War. Subsequently, many of its battalions were transferred to the Far East to train troops in jungle warfare for the Burma Campaign.
    	The startling success of the Blitzkrieg and Panzer Divisions showed the Allies the power of modern armored combat. Under Major-General Percy Hobart, Britain formed the 11th Armoured Division in 1941 to bolster its armoured forces.
    	The ‘Black Bull’ trained diligently from 1941 until June 1944, where it swept through Normandy. The 11th spearheaded the drive to Amiens, the fastest and deepest Allied penetration of German lines, before capturing Antwerp in September.
    	After securing the Netherlands in late 1944, the ‘Black Bull’ struggled to break German defenses along the Lower Rhine. Finally crossing into Germany in March 1945, the 11th captured Lübeck in May before liberating Bergen-Belsen in April.

    	In desperate need of more armoured divisions, British high command formed the Guards Armoured Division in 1941. Under the command of Major General Sir Allan Adair, most of its recruits were from other Guards units.
    	After receiving Britain’s best equipment and tanks, the Guards spearheaded Operation Goodwood in early July. Suffering tremendous losses at Cagny against the 1st SS and 12th SS Division, the Guards were relieved on 30 July.
    	As the tip of the spear for XXX Corps, the Guards advanced steadily across Northwest Europe. Crossing Nijmegen Bridge in September, the Guards garrisoned the Netherlands until early 1945 before finishing the war in Bremen.
    	One of Canada’s first fully equipped regiments to mobilize, the Seaforth Highlanders fought at Dieppe under Canada’s 2nd Division in August 1942 before landing in Sicily with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division in July 1943.
    	The Highlanders fought veteran German units across Sicily and drove the enemy into northern Italy in September 1943. Having advanced 300 miles from Sicily, the regiment spearheaded the assault on the Gustav Line in December.
    	In December 1943, the Highlanders engaged in brutal urban combat at Ortona, nicknaming the town ‘Little Stalingrad’. Smashing the Hitler Line in May 1944, a series of German counter attacks reduced the regiment to eight men.
    	Formed in 1794 as a light cavalry regiment, the Sherwood Rangers fought in Africa for nearly a century. Serving honorably in the First World War, the Yeomanry was still equipped with horses when the Second World War began in 1939. 
    	Converted to an armoured regiment in 1940, the Yeomanry staunchly defended Tobruk and spearheaded British offensives in Africa. Transferred for Operation Overlord, the Yeomanry was the first British force to land at Gold Beach.
    	Known as Britain’s finest armoured regiment, the Yeomanry would fight with every British infantry division on the Continent. In late 1944 they became the first Allied unit to breach the Siegfried Line and step on German soil.
    	Built under the Wehrmacht in July 1941, the ‘volunteers against Bolshevism’ lost half its men at the Battle of Moscow. Pulled in early 1942 for anti-partisan duty, it was resent to the front when Army Group Centre collapsed in June 1944.
    	Numbering only 7,340 men, ‘Charlemagne’ crippled the overwhelming Soviet forces. Withdrawn to Neustrelitz with less than 700 men, 600 volunteered to fight in Berlin but only 300 were able to reach the dying heart of the once proud Reich.
