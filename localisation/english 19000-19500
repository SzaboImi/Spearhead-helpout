    	Similar to many units in the Regio Esercito, ‘Toscana’ was extremely depleted at the outbreak of war. Short on adequate training, armor and artillery support due to an insufficient budget, the 7th was nearly routed by Greek forces in early 1941.
    	Trained primarily through trial by fire, ‘Toscana’ acted as anti-partisan and coastal defense troops in France until fall 1943. Shifted to Rome with only 3 active battalions, the 7th held vital airfields for two long, grueling days before disintegrating.
    	Bolstered by extra supplies, these troops can frequently employ abilities against Allied forces.
    	Despite continuously high losses, ‘Wallonien’ continued to request frontline service under the SS. Reinforced with fascist French and Spanish volunteers, the 28th fought courageously to the bitter end as an understrength Grenadier division.
    	As it fought its way west ‘Das Reich’ expended seventy percent of its remaining equipment and men. At Prague, Dresden and Vienna it helped thousands of civilians flee the barbaric Red Army before yielding to U.S. forces in May 1945.
    	Already highly adept at their trade, Aufklärer of the 600th received extended instruction to further their skills at recon. Trained to perform clandestine operations, they could infiltrate enemy lines and collect intelligence practically undetected.
    	Equipped with the ten-tubed, rapid firing 15 cm Nebelwerfer 41, the ‘Panzerwerfer’ was based on the 1941 Opel Maultier. Designed to drench large areas within 6.5 km, it could hammer enemy forces with a hail of devastating rocketfire.
    	Designed to replace the outdated Boys, the PIAT allowed British tank-hunters to actively hound enemy armor. Capable but still inconsistent, these teams could reliably vanquish most medium tanks and confront the heavier German ‘Big Cats’.

    	Deployed under the famed ‘Desert Rats’, the mechanized 11th was invaluable in the fight against Axis forces in North Africa. Following the 7th Armoured into Italy and France, the unit embodied the conspicuous gallantry of its storied forefathers.
    	Part of the 79th Armoured, the 1st was tasked with clearing obstacles under heavy artillery fire on Sword Beach. Culminating in its finest hour, the unit smashed German defenses and opened the channel for the long-awaited liberation of Europe.

    	Assigned to the Eighth Army, the 2nd played a prominent role in the Axis defeat in North Africa. Sent to Italy in late 1943, the ‘Kiwis’ furthered their reputation for audacity and heroism at Monte Cassino and in the assaults on the Gothic Line.
    	Finally relieved in late 1941, the 2/17th held the line again in both battles for El Alamein. Pulled to Australia in early 1943 and retrained for jungle warfare, the unit took part in the brutal battle to liberate Borneo and neighboring islands in 1945.
    	Built on the mobile M3 chassis, the M16 was originally designed to combat low-flying aircraft. Despite the limited numbers received through Lend-Lease, the MGMC was frequently used as a fire-support platform by British infantry.

    	Spacious enough to carry two squads, the M3 became the core of Britain’s transportation corps. Although its open-top left it vulnerable to artillery, its M2HB .50 Cal provided powerful support fire.
