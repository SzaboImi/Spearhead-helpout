    	The backbone of SS mechanized recon units, the four-wheel-drive Sdkfz. 221 was advanced for its time. Relying on mobility as its primary characteristic, it provided its two-man crew adequate small arms protection with 14.5 mm of armor.
    	A communications variant of the reliable Sdkfz. 221, the Sdkfz. 261 was fitted with a foldable ‘bed-frame’ antenna. Able to coordinate with ground forces and capture territory, it boosts manpower income to combat the Allied hordes.
    	A nimble hunter, the Sdkfz. 234/2 mated an innovative eight-wheeled chassis with a 5 cm L/60 and coaxial MG34. Enhancing the agile recon units of the SS, the ‘Puma’ could reach a ninety km/hr max speed but suffered on softer terrain.

    	Designed to replace the Flakpanzer ‘Wirbelwind’, only 44 models of the rare ‘Ostwind’ finished production. Swapping the quad-barrelled 2 cm for a single, stronger 3.7 cm FlaK 43, it could shred infantry, light vehicles and fortifications.
    	The outdated Panzer IV Ausf. F1 suffered from low frontal armor and a low-velocity 7.5 cm KwK 37. Loaded with large quantities of HEAT and HE rounds to compensate, it was only useful against structures, infantry and light armor.

    	The old Ausf. G chassis was unable to mount the Schürzen of later Panzer IV models, leading to poor performance against contemporary Soviet armor. Despite a weaker defense, it remained a threat with its long-barreled 7.5 KwK 40 L/43.
    	The adaptable Panzer IV underwent several redesigns during the war to maintain a frontline presence. The Ausf. H’s lethal 7.5 cm KwK 40 could punch holes in long range targets while integrated side-skirts enhanced survivability.
    	Captured in considerable quantities, the reliable, easy to fix Sherman served mainly as a recovery vehicle and munitions carrier. Renamed the M4-748, it found increasing frontline service as the strength of the SS Panzer divisions waned.

    	Designed as mobile artillery support for infantry, the StuG III Ausf. E could pulverize light armor and emplacements. Able to inflict substantial damage with its 7.5 cm StuK 37, it lacked adequate armor penetration to tackle heavier foes.
    	Mounting the vaunted 7.5 cm StuK 50 L/48, the Ausf. F8 was highly effective as Germany’s first tank destroyer. Mounting additional frontal armor on the already durable StuG chassis, it was difficult to spot and harder to destroy
    	The increased armor and low profile of the StuG III allowed it to effectively compete against Allied tanks. A true multi-role assault gun, its high velocity 7.5 cm StuK 40 could easily defeat most enemy armor at long range.

    	Safer than the open topped ‘Marder’ series, the ‘Hetzer’ was based off the pre-war Panzer 38(t) from Czechoslovakia. Using its formidable 7.5 cm PaK 39 and low armor profile it could ambush and destroy all but the heaviest Allied armor.

    	Able to incinerate opposition out to 60 m with its Koebe Flammenwerfer, the ‘Flamm Hetzer’ terrified enemy infantry. Carrying over 150 gallons of flame fuel in a vulnerable armored hide, an incendiary death awaited both enemy and crew.

    	A modified Panzer IV Ausf. H chassis, the low profile, well armored ‘Jagdpanzer’ excelled as a Panzerjäger. Armed with the venerable 7.5 cm PaK 39 L/48, only the heaviest Allied armor could survive encounters against this predator.

    	Although considered less effective than the numerous StuGs, the ‘Jagdpanzer IV’ remained a powerful hunter. Later upgraded with a heavier gun and Schürzen, the increased weight earned it the derisive nickname ‘Guderian’s Duck’.
    	The pride of the Fatherland, the ‘Panther’ was a medium tank only in name. Combining sloped armor, mobility and the excellent 7.5 cm KwK 42, it could go toe to toe with heavy tanks or stalk and brutalize medium tanks.

    	Armed with the 12.8 cm Pak 44 L/55, the ‘Jagdtiger’ could effortlessly reduce any Allied tank to melted scrap. Capable of firing out to 24,410 m, the mighty ‘Hunting Tiger’ could engage enemy tanks well beyond normal fighting distances.

    	Feldfunkgerät
    	The development of superior tank armor made the highly portable PaK 36 obsolete by 1940. Used by the SS until the end of the war, the rapid firing ‘door knocker’ was extremely effective as an armored car and light vehicle killer.

    	Subjected to intense schooling and medical examinations, RAMC medics were some of the finest of the war. Capable of treating the most egregious wounds, these men kept Britain’s forces ready to fight.
    	Instructed to work closely with allied units, British Tank-Hunters practiced patience, caution and unity of arms. Equipped with the capable but underwhelming PIAT, these teams could reliably vanquish all but the heaviest German armor.

    	An improved model of the older FlaK 30, the FlaK 38 was designed to counter the increasing speeds of low-altitude fighter bombers. With a heavier shell, improved ballistics and deadlier impact, the 2 cm decimated aircraft.
    	The 251/16 was produced in large quantities for the Wehrmacht’s highly mobile Panzergrenadiere and Pioniere regiments. Outfitted with dual flame projectors, the ‘Flammpanzerwagen’ could methodically eliminate infantry and structures.

    	Mounted with a unique 60 cm infrared searchlight, roughly sixty Sdkfz. 251/20 models saw service in late 1944. In tandem with IR equipped Panthers and ‘Vampir’ scopes on the Stg 44, the ‘Uhu’ illuminated targets out to 1.5 km.
    	The Ausf. J was a retrograde design intended for fast production and rapid replacement of the demolished Wehrmacht Panzer divisions. Despite a slow hand cranked turret, it performed admirably with its precise 7.5 KwK 40 L/48.

    	Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf. J
    	Covered in virtually impenetrable armor and armed with the upgraded 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71, the ‘Tiger II’ was truly the ‘King’ of German armor. Although only 492 models ever entered active service, the tank was unrivaled on the field.
    	Crippled by its weight and lacking anti-infantry measures, the ‘Ferdinand’ was redesigned in Fall 1943. Equipped with a better engine, drivetrain and hull MG34, the new ‘Elefant’ ended the war with an impressive kill ratio of 10:1.
    	Raised as part of the 15th wave of mobilization, draftees of the 716. Infanterie-Division were too old or sick to serve in active duty units. In desperate need of men, it supplemented its ranks with large numbers of foreign conscripts.
    	Less than 1,500 survivors of the 716th’s original 7,716 men were mustered in Le Mans by July 1st. Destroyed again a month later during Anvil Dragoon, the OKW reformed survivors in April 1945 into the 716. Volksgrenadier-Division.

    	Afrika-Korps veterans, the 21. Panzer-Division acted as the armored reserve for the 716th and 352nd IDs. Fielding a mix of converted French tanks with both new and old Panzers, the 21st fought in vain to halt Allied armored forces.

    	Despite impossible odds, most Panzers of the 21st fought to their last shell. Ordered to continue the battle on foot, surviving crews were used to reinforce other Panzer and Infanterie units in the futile attempt to hold Normandy and France.
    	Deployed deep behind enemy lines in Afrika, ‘Brandenburg’ Sprengtruppe constantly disrupted Allied supply and communication lines. Shifted to Russia in 1943, these men infiltrated and leveled several key supply and transport depots.
    	15. Panzergrenadier-Division Pz.Bfw. IV Ausf. H
    	Panzer-Abteilung 190 Panzerbefehlswagen Sdkfz. 267
    	Created in August 1942, Panzer-Abteilung 190 was attached to the 90. leichte-Afrika-Division for service in Afrika. Forging a reputation for tireless aggression, the unit fought with the 90th until its absolute destruction in Tunis in May 1943.

    	Resurrected like much of the Afrika-Korps in July 1943, the 190th was assigned to the defense of Italy. Serving under the 90. Panzergrenadier-Division, crews of the 190th were instrumental in keeping the outnumbered Panzers operational.
