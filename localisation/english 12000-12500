    	The ‘GvB’ surrendered to US forces on 7. Mai 1945 as the only SS division to have fought exclusively on the West Front. The 17th existed and trained for only eight months before D-Day and fought without respite for twelve.
    	Reinforced with 14,816 men in fall 1944, the ‘GvB’ unrelentingly defended Metz against U.S. forces without reinforcement. Reduced to 4,000 men and forced out in November, it received 12,000 men for Unternehmen Nordwind.
    	A ferocious defense of Caen and Falaise against the British reduced the 9th to fifty percent strength by July. Withdrawn to Arnhem, it annihilated the British 1st Airborne during Market Garden where it inflicted 7,167 casualties. 
    	Of the 2,500 Wehrmacht and SS troops recruited by the 150th only 400 spoke English fluently. Limited to five weeks of training and suffering from poor logistics, the unit was ill-prepared to begin Unternehmen Greif in December 1944.
    	Commanded by the legendary Otto Skorzeny, the 150th was first ordered to capture vital bridges along the Meuse River. Losing valuable time to massive traffic jams, it was converted to a regular formation and tasked with seizing Malmedy.
    	After purging the SA in July 1934, ‘LSSAH’ served as occupational troops during the Nazi Reich expansion. Lacking the experience of the seasoned Wehrmacht, the unit suffered needless losses against Polish infantry during the Blitzkrieg.
    	1. SS-Panzer-Division Untersturmführer
    	The ‘LSSAH’ rarely kept prisoners for long and throughout the war butchered thousands of  POWs and civilians. Loyal to Fatherland and Führer, the 1st committed numerous atrocities and massacres on both the West and Ostfront.
    	Assigned to counter Italian resistance in 1943, ‘LSSAH’ was transferred back to France in response to D-Day. With 22,000 men, it tenaciously defended Caen, but was pulled to refit for the defense of France, and Ardennes Offensive.
    	Using defense in depth and overwhelming firepower, the 3rd FJD held St.-Lô for a month against U.S forces. Finally exhausting their supplies, the 3rd was pushed to the Falaise Pocket in August only to be obliterated in the breakout attempt.
    	Reformed from scratch in September 1944, the 3rd FJD helped defend Arnhem during Operation Market Garden. Later fighting in the Hürtgenwald meat-grinder and the Ardennes offensive, the unit finally surrendered to U.S forces in 1945.
